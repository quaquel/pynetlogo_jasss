pyNetLogo documentation
=======================

Interface to use and access `NetLogo <https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/>`_ (Wilensky 1999) from Python. 
One can interact with NetLogo in either headless (no GUI) or interactive GUI 
mode. The library provides functions to load models, execute commands, and 
get values from reporters. It is compatible with NetLogo 5.2, 5.3, and 6.0. 
It is largely similar to the 'NetLogo' `Mathematica Link <https://github.com/NetLogo/Mathematica-Link>`_ 
and `RNetLogo <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RNetLogo/index.html>`_.
